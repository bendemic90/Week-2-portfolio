# Week-2-portfolio
* A bootstrapped page from the ground up, with a Bio, Contact form and Portfolio page. 

## Features
* semantic html
* placeholder images in Portfolio
* functional linking back and forth between all 3 pages
* responsive structure across all devices
* fullscreen columns on small devices

## Reasoning
Responsive websites seems to be a minimum requirement these days. Everyone views webpages through a variety of mediums from smart phones all the way up to desktop computers. A typical website without responsiveness won't scale down appropriately for smaller devices; in this manner you can create a website that will function through whatever viewport the user has access to.

## Challenges
Initially I had difficulty getting the index.html contents to wrap properly through all viewports. Sometimes the text would overlay the picture, sometimes the picture would skew horizontally or vertically; ruining my dream of it remaining a perfect square.
My portfolio page felt fairly straightforward, I wanted six pictures divided into thirds across two rows, so that the consumer would get three pictures across the screen with another identical three below them.
Using 'col-xs-12 and col-sm-4' you achieve pictures that will go fullscreen on small devices, and for everything else it will divide into thirds.
I also had to add some custom CSS in the form of padding-bottom, as they were part of the same row there was no pixel gap between them.
