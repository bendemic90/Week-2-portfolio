                  My name is Ben, and I am a fledgling full stack developer,
                  enrolled in a University of Adelaide bootcamp course. I wanted
                  to get into web development as a means of providing myself
                  with more flexible and long term employment opportunities.
                  Many of my friends are software developers and have been a
                  ongoing source of inspiration and encouragement to get myself
                  into this field of work.

                  In my personal life I am an avid player of computer games, and
                  have been since I first touched a Super Nintendo (SNES) in the
                  early 90's. This passion for gaming and PC's more generally
                  has inevitably lead me to pursuing a career in IT. I have a
                  strong interest in programmatic solutions to problems, having
                  scripted and automated as many actions as I possibly could in
                  video games throughout the years. I also love coffee and
                  welcome any suggestions of related cafes to try out in and
                  around Adelaide.
                  <hr />
                  I finished Year 12 in 2007 and tried my hand at University,
                  doing the first year of CompSci but going no further than
                  that. I found full time work to have much more utility at that
                  age, and so I did just that for the next 10 years in various
                  sales roles.
